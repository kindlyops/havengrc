# github.com/markbates/going

This project houses, what I consider to be some help packages for writing Go applications. Your mileage may vary, but I find them to be pretty darn helpful.

## Packages

* [nulls](./nulls) - Proper JSON implementations of `null` database types.
* [validate](./validate) - A framework for writing validations.
* [wait](./wait) - Wait cleans up the pattern around using `sync.WaitGroup`.
* [defaults](./defaults) - Allows for the setting of default values for common types.
* [willy](./willy) - A helper for cleaning up HTTP tests.
* [del](./del) - A wrapper around the [render](https://github.com/unrolled/render) package to make it work with [echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo).
